    <h1>Steps:</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper.</li> 
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li> 
        <li>In another bowl, whisk eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla until smooth.</li> 
        <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li> 
        <li>Slowly pour in the hot water (or coffee) and mix until the batter is smooth (it will be thin).</li> 
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.</li> 
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li> 
        <li>Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li> 
        <li>To make the frosting, beat the butter in a large bowl until creamy.</li> 
        <li>Add cocoa powder, powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, and salt. Beat until smooth and fluffy.</li> 
        <li>Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a layer of frosting on top.</li> 
        <li>Add the second cake layer and frost the top and sides of the cake evenly.</li> 
        <li>Decorate with chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or fresh berries if desired.</li>
